# Digital_Twin
This project builds a Digital Twin for predictive maintenance using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPClassifier), achieving 99% accuracy. Developed with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, it analyzes sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure, noise) to predict failure conditions. The models are evaluated using a classification report and confusion matrix, ensuring reliability in maintenance predictions. This solution enables proactive issue detection, reduced downtime, and cost savings.
