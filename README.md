# Digital_Twin
This Jupyter Notebook, titled Digital_Twin.ipynb, is designed to simulate and analyze synthetic manufacturing data for predictive maintenance applications. It generates a dataset containing sensor readings (temperature, vibration, pressure, noise level), operating hours, and a binary indicator for maintenance needs. The notebook includes data analysis and visualization techniques, such as correlation heatmaps and feature distributions, to help identify patterns and relationships in the data. This project serves as a practical tool for understanding digital twin concepts and their applications in manufacturing environments.
